Capstone Project AR-TourGuide CH2-PS105


Many people enjoy visiting famous tourist attractions in Indonesia, but not everyone knows about the history and information about these tourist attractions. Here we find innovative solutions that respond to the needs of people in Indonesia, especially for travel and tourism lovers. The application combines Augmented Reality (AR) technology with rich tourism information, allowing users to get the most out of their tourism experience. In a country with diverse culture, history and natural beauty like Indonesia, this application allows users to access relevant real-time information, utilize real-world objects around them, and enjoy more in-depth and easy-to-access tourism experience information. Thus, this application has the potential to increase the attractiveness of tourism in Indonesia and provide significant benefits for local and international tourists. Then, there is a map feature that displays the locations of tourist attractions, restaurants and other services around the user. Users can also save or share information about interesting tourist attractions. To increase user engagement, the application may include interactive quizzes related to certain attractions. This application is expected to help tourists to better understand and appreciate tourist attractions by presenting interactive and interesting information content.
